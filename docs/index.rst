Bossman Docs
===================================

Bossman is a command line tool for Akamai GitOps. It helps automate the deployment and release management
of Akamai product configurations that are maintained in `git`.

It is an alternative to the Akamai pipeline CLI and the Akamai terraform provider, and may be useful if:

* the linear deployment model imposed by `akamai pipeline` is too rigid
* your organization is not ready for terraform
* you wish to automate more resources than what those currently support

.. topic:: About the author

   My name is Anthony Hogg, and I am an Enterprise Architect working at Akamai Technologies. I maintain
   Bossman to help my customers apply DevOps methodologies to their Akamai configurations in those cases
   where existing tooling is not a perfect fit.

.. topic:: Disclaimer

   Bossman is not officially supported by Akamai Technologies. I provide support, fixes and features
   on a best-effort basis with a priority on the requirements of my customers, but I also try to be as
   responsive as possible, and welcome contributions.
