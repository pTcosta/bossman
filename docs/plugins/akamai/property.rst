Akamai Property
================================



Bossman structures property version notes, by encoding:

- the commit message
- metadata about the commit, including

  - the abbreviated commit hash
  - the branches containing the commit
  - the author
  - if applicable, the committer

The purpose is twofold. It improves the quality of property version
notes; if a good git commit message convention is in place, it is
automatically applied to the property version.

It also provides a mechanism for bossman to correlate property versions
with git revisions.
