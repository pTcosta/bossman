Bossman Docs
===================================

Bossman is a command line tool for Akamai GitOps. It helps automate the deployment and release management
of Akamai product configurations that are maintained in `git`.

It is an alternative to the Akamai pipeline CLI and the Akamai terraform provider, and may be useful if:

* the linear deployment model imposed by `akamai pipeline` is too rigid
* your organization is not ready for terraform
* you wish to automate more resources than what those currently support
